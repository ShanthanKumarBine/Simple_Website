Created two web pages using HTML and CSS. It contains a hyperlink to the other page. The pages have headings, body text, image, ordered list, unordered list, and table.

I used both ordered and unordered list in pages at different places. Ordered list in page1 and unordered list in page2.

I choose apple product as my theme and designed around it.

iphone 15 pro max details and description was used in this website.

Both pages have hyperlinks, you can go to and fro from each page.

I used Visual Studio code as IDE.

Thank you.
